This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for "Working With Twitter Data," a workshop that I led as part of Cornell's 2019 Day of Data. This notebook can be explored live and without prior installation through Binder. The tutorial demonstrates how to collect and analyze Twitter data with Twarc and Twint.
